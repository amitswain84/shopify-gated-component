# âœ… Payment Flow Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### Issue
After successful payment on Lemon Squeezy, users were redirected to a generic "enter email" page instead of back to the app with PRO access.

### Solution
1. âœ… **Added redirect URLs** to checkout session
2. âœ… **Success page** redirects to dashboard with success message
3. âœ… **Auto-refresh plan** on dashboard after payment
4. âœ… **Success notification** shows "Welcome to Pro!"
5. âœ… **Improved webhook** to handle order_created event immediately

## How It Works Now

### Payment Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro"
   â†“
2. Creates checkout session with redirect URL
   â†“
3. User completes payment on Lemon Squeezy
   â†“
4. Success message: "Welcome to Pro! Your account has been upgraded"
   â†“
5. "Go to Dashboard" button redirects to: yourdomain.com/dashboard?upgrade=success
   â†“
6. Dashboard shows success notification
   â†“
7. Plan is automatically updated to PRO
   â†“
8. User has immediate access to all PRO features
```

### What Changed

#### 1. Checkout Session (lib/lemonsqueezy.ts)
- Added `redirect_url` pointing to your dashboard
- Added `receipt_button_text`: "Go to Dashboard"
- Added `receipt_link_url`: Returns to dashboard
- Added custom thank you message

#### 2. Dashboard (app/dashboard/page.tsx)
- Fetches actual user plan on load
- Detects `?upgrade=success` parameter
- Shows success notification banner
- Auto-refreshes plan data
- Removes query parameter after showing message

#### 3. Webhook (api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts)
- Already handles `order_created` event
- Immediately grants PAID + ACTIVE status
- Improved user_id extraction

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Start Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Payment
1. Sign in to your app
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
3. Complete test payment on Lemon Squeezy
4. After payment success:
   - See "Welcome to Pro!" message from Lemon Squeezy
   - Click "Go to Dashboard" button
   - Should redirect to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?upgrade=success`
5. Dashboard shows:
   - Green success banner: "Welcome to Pro! ðŸŽ‰"
   - Plan updated to "PRO"
   - Access to all 50+ components

### 3. Verify Access
- Try accessing a PRO component
- Check PRO checklist items
- Both should be unlocked

## Important: Webhook Configuration

For immediate access after payment, webhook must be configured:

### In Lemon Squeezy Dashboard:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Webhooks
2. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`
3. Enable these events:
   - âœ… `order_created` (CRITICAL - grants access immediately)
   - âœ… `subscription_created`
   - âœ… `subscription_updated`
   - âœ… `subscription_payment_success`
4. Copy webhook secret to `.env.local`

### For Local Testing:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Use ngrok URL in Lemon Squeezy webhook settings
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in `apps/web/.env.local`:

```env
# Lemon Squeezy (already configured)
LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY=eyJ0eXAi... âœ…
LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=234298 âœ…
LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID=1053010 âœ…
LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=rgRffmz14PYKSCTSVtn9ZcFaHOnOCVKV âœ…

# App URL (for redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Change to production URL when deploying
```

## Success Notification Details

The success banner:
- âœ… Appears automatically when redirected from payment
- âœ… Shows for 10 seconds then auto-hides
- âœ… Can be manually closed with X button
- âœ… Only shows once per successful payment
- âœ… URL is cleaned (removes ?upgrade=success)

## Troubleshooting

### Payment success but no PRO access

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Webhook received? (check server logs)
3. Database subscription updated? (check Prisma Studio)
4. User ID in webhook matches Clerk ID?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check webhook logs in terminal where dev server runs
# Look for: "Order created and subscription activated for user: [userId]"

# Check database
cd packages/database
pnpm db:studio
# Look at Subscription table - should show PAID + ACTIVE
```

### Redirect not working

**Check:**
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly
2. Lemon Squeezy product settings allow custom redirect
3. Browser not blocking redirect

### Success message not showing

**Check:**
1. URL has `?upgrade=success` parameter
2. Dashboard page loaded properly
3. No JavaScript errors in console

## Production Deployment

Before deploying:

1. Update `.env` with production URL:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Update webhook URL in Lemon Squeezy:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy
   ```

3. Test the complete flow on production

## Expected User Experience

1. **Click "Upgrade to Pro"** â†’ Button shows "Processing..."
2. **Redirected to checkout** â†’ Lemon Squeezy payment page
3. **Complete payment** â†’ See success message
4. **Click "Go to Dashboard"** â†’ Returns to your app
5. **Success notification** â†’ "Welcome to Pro! ðŸŽ‰"
6. **Immediate access** â†’ All PRO features unlocked

**Total time: < 30 seconds from payment to access**

The flow is now seamless and professional! ðŸš€
