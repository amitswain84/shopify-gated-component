# ‚úÖ Checkout Flow Fixed

## Problem Identified

The Lemon Squeezy API was rejecting checkout requests with error:
```
"The field :field is not a supported :type."
```

## Root Cause

The checkout API request was including unsupported fields in the attributes object. Lemon Squeezy has strict validation and rejects requests with unknown fields.

## Solution

Simplified the API request to only include supported fields:
- ‚úÖ Minimal required: `store` and `variant` relationships
- ‚úÖ Optional: `checkout_data` (email, name, custom data)
- ‚úÖ Optional: `product_options` (redirect_url)
- ‚ùå Removed: Unsupported fields that were causing errors

## What Was Fixed

### 1. API Request Format (`lib/lemonsqueezy.ts`)
```javascript
// Before: Included many unsupported fields
// After: Only supported fields
{
  data: {
    type: 'checkouts',
    attributes: {
      checkout_data: {
        email: "user@example.com",
        name: "User Name",
        custom: {
          user_id: "clerk_user_id"
        }
      },
      product_options: {
        redirect_url: "http://yourdomain.com/dashboard?upgrade=success"
      }
    },
    relationships: {
      store: { data: { type: 'stores', id: '234298' } },
      variant: { data: { type: 'variants', id: '1053010' } }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Detailed Error Logging
- Console logs show exactly what's being sent to Lemon Squeezy
- API errors are parsed and displayed with details
- Makes debugging much easier

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages in API responses
- Catches and logs all errors with context
- Returns helpful messages to frontend

## Test Results

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create checkout session"

**Check server logs for:**
```
Creating checkout for user: [user_id]
Using variant ID: [variant_id]
Lemon Squeezy request body: {...}
```

**Common issues:**
1. Invalid API key
2. Wrong store/variant ID
3. API rate limiting

### Checkout created but redirect not working

**Check:**
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly
2. Look for "Checkout URL created:" in logs
3. Verify URL is accessible

### Payment success but no PRO access

**Check:**
1. Webhook configured correctly
2. Check server logs for: "Order created and subscription activated"
3. Verify database updated (use Prisma Studio)

## Test Script

Run this to verify API connectivity:
```bash
node test-lemonsqueezy.js
```

Should output:
```
‚úÖ API Key: eyJ0...
‚úÖ Store ID: 234298
‚úÖ Variant ID: 1053010
‚úÖ Success! Checkout created
üéâ Lemon Squeezy API is working correctly!
