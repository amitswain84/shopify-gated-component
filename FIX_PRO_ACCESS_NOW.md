# üîß Fix PRO Access After Payment - Complete Guide

## Problem
After completing payment, you're redirected but still don't have PRO access because:
1. Webhook hasn't been triggered (no public URL for local dev)
2. Database subscription not updated
3. Frontend still showing FREE plan

## ‚úÖ Immediate Solution - Use Admin Page

### Go to Admin Page
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin
```

### Click "Grant PRO Access Now"
This will:
- Update database: `plan=PAID`, `status=ACTIVE`
- Give immediate PRO access
- Bypass webhook requirement

### Then:
1. Refresh any page
2. Dashboard should show "PRO"
3. PRO components unlocked
4. PRO checklist items accessible

## üîç Why This Happens

### Local Development Issue
- Lemon Squeezy needs a public URL to send webhooks
- `localhost:3000` is not accessible from internet
- Webhook never fires ‚Üí Database never updates
- You stay on FREE plan even after payment

### Production Won't Have This Issue
Once deployed with public URL, webhooks will work automatically.

## üöÄ Complete Fix for Local Testing

### Option 1: Use Admin Page (Easiest)
1. Go to `/dashboard/admin`
2. Click "Grant PRO Access Now"
3. Done! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Update Database Manually
Using Prisma Studio:
```bash
cd packages/database
pnpm db:studio
```

1. Open Subscription table
2. Find your subscription
3. Update fields:
   - `plan`: PAID
   - `status`: ACTIVE
4. Save
5. Refresh app

### Option 3: Use ngrok for Real Webhooks
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Copy ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Update webhook in Lemon Squeezy to: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy
# Make another test payment
# Webhook will fire and update database
```

## üìä Verify PRO Access

After granting access, check these places:

### 1. Dashboard
Navigate to: `/dashboard`
- Plan card shows: **"PRO"** (not "FREE")
- Components count: **"50+"** (not "20")

### 2. API Response
Check in browser console or visit:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/user/plan
```
Should return:
```json
{
  "plan": "PAID",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "subscription": {
    "plan": "PAID",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }
}
```

### 3. Components Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/components?filter=premium`
- PRO components have NO lock overlay
- Click any PRO component ‚Üí See code (not upgrade prompt)

### 4. Checklist Page
Navigate to: `/dashboard/shopify-checklist`
- Switch to "Pro" tab
- All 5 PRO items accessible
- No lock overlay
- Can check/uncheck items

## üêõ If Still Not Working

### Clear Browser Cache
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

### Check Database
```bash
cd packages/database
pnpm db:studio
```

In Subscription table, verify:
- Record exists for your user
- `plan`: "PAID"
- `status`: "ACTIVE"

### Check User Hook
In browser console, check if useUserPlan is returning correct data:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. Should see: "Loaded checklist items: [...]"
4. Check Network tab for `/api/user/plan` response

### Force Update
If database is correct but UI still shows FREE:

1. **Clear localStorage**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl + Shift + R

3. **Navigate around**: Click between pages to trigger re-fetch

## üìù Summary of Files That Check Access

### 1. Dashboard (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Fetches plan on mount
- Shows PRO or FREE
- Displays correct component count

### 2. Components (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/components/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Server-side check: `subscription.plan === 'PAID' && subscription.status === 'ACTIVE'`
- Shows code if access granted

### 3. Checklist (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/shopify-checklist/page.tsx`)
- Uses `useUserPlan()` hook
- Shows lock overlay if `plan === 'FREE'`
- Enables PRO items if `plan === 'PRO'`

### 4. API (`apps/web/src/app/api/user/plan/route.ts`)
- Returns user plan from database
- Checks: `plan === 'PAID' && status === 'ACTIVE'`
