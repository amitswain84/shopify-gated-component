ðŸš¨ URGENT: Payment Not Working - Quick Fix
=============================================

PROBLEM:
--------
The "Upgrade to Pro" button does nothing because Lemon Squeezy
credentials in .env.local are set to "xxx" (placeholder values).

SOLUTION:
---------
1. Open: apps/web/.env.local

2. Find these lines:
   LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=xxx
   LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID=xxx
   LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=xxx

3. Replace "xxx" with your actual Lemon Squeezy credentials:
   - Get Store ID from: Lemon Squeezy â†’ Settings â†’ Stores
   - Get Variant ID from: Lemon Squeezy â†’ Products â†’ [Your Product] â†’ [Variant]
   - Get Webhook Secret from: Lemon Squeezy â†’ Settings â†’ Webhooks

4. Save the file

5. Restart your dev server:
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop
   - Run: pnpm dev

6. Test by clicking "Upgrade to Pro"

WHERE TO GET CREDENTIALS:
-------------------------
Login to: https://app.lemonsqueezy.com

Store ID: Settings â†’ Stores (remove # symbol)
Variant ID: Products â†’ Click product â†’ Click variant
Webhook Secret: Settings â†’ Webhooks â†’ Create/Edit webhook â†’ Copy signing secret

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
âœ“ Added error handling to show helpful messages
âœ“ Added loading state ("Processing...") 
âœ“ Added console logs for debugging
âœ“ Code now detects "xxx" placeholder and shows error
âœ“ Enhanced pricing cards with better feedback

DEBUGGING:
----------
If still not working after fixing credentials:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
3. Look for messages like:
   - "Creating checkout session..."
   - "Checkout session created: ..."
   - Any error messages
